# DoughChecker.ai

DoughChecker.ai is an application that analyzes images of dough to calculate its roundness. It consists of a Python backend (using Flask and OpenCV) for image processing and a Next.js frontend for the user interface.

## Overview

- **Backend:**  
  Uses Flask to provide an API endpoint `/api/analyze`. The endpoint accepts an uploaded image, processes it using OpenCV to find and analyze the largest contour, calculates a roundness score, and returns the score along with a processed image (encoded in base64).

- **Frontend:**  
  Uses Next.js with React and Tailwind CSS. The frontend captures image uploads, sends them to the backend via a POST request (through a proxy rewrite for local development or via Vercel routing in production), and displays the roundness score along with the processed image.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/)

## Local Development Setup

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. Install the backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask backend:
   ```bash
   python api/analyze.py
   ```
   The Flask server will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
3. (Optional) For Tailwind CSS, if not already set up:
   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npm install --save-dev @types/react
   ```

4. Start the Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Your Next.js application will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
